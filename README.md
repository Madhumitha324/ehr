Apply GenAI for denoising and realistic reconstruction of medical images.
Improve image resolution and clarity to support better visualization for clinicians.
Train image enhancement models using Azure OpenAI tools.
Module 3: Clinical Note Generation & ICD-10 Coding Automation
Objective: Automate routine documentation and coding tasks using Generative AI.
Key Tasks:
Generate clinical notes based on structured data and doctor observations.
Automate ICD-10 coding by mapping EHR input to standard classifications.
Decrease documentation workload through seamless integration of GenAI tools.
Module 4: Integration and Deployment
Objective: Successfully deploy and integrate the enhanced EHR features into live clinical environments.
Key Tasks:
Deploy trained GenAI models into real-time clinical workflows.
Integrate the solution with existing hospital EHR systems for image processing and note generation.
Provide necessary onboarding and training sessions for medical staff to ensure effective use of the new tools.
